# Scala: Graceful Exception Handling in Setter Method

This example illustrates how to implement robust error handling in a Scala class using a setter method.  The code defines a `MyClass` with a private `age` variable and enforces positive ages through exception handling within the setter.  This approach prevents unexpected behavior from negative age values and provides informative error messages.  The accompanying test cases demonstrate both successful and exceptional scenarios.
